Can shifts only be covered by one person?
Do breaks need to be managed, or can employees decide between them?
Does the structure, i.e. 3 shifts per day of the same length (8.5hrs) with three slots for each?
Says 10 hours rest overnight, this is taken to mean just 10 hours break between any two shifts.
What is the qualification structure like? Are all of the supplied employees qualified for all the available shifts? Should some less qualified work with more qualified?
